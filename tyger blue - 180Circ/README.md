# tyger blue - 180Circ

This video was created using two audio reactive [processing](https://processing.org) sketches.

You will need the processing lib `video export` && ffmpeg installed on linux.

The outputed video's were combined together using the blender3D video editor.

The sketches utilise offline rendering to create an mp4 video with perfectly syncronised audio and visuals.
